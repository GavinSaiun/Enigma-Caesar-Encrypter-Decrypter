Create and test an Enigma machine encryption and decoding machine

"""
Enigma Machine is a cipher device used in WW2. Core components include rotor
and plugboard. Usually most enigmas have 5-8 rotors, in which 3 are chosen. Each
Rotor contains 26 scrambled letters and as the operator presses a letter to be 
ciphered, the rotor would rotate. As the first rotor makes a full rotation, the 
second rotor would rotate one place and so on. Thus, the key is everchanging. 

To decrypt a message, one must have the initial key set up and knowledge of both
the rotors used and plugboard settings.
